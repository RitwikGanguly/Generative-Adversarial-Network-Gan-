# Generative Adversarial Network

---

**GAN is an unsupervised deep learning algorithm where we have a Generator pitted against an adversarial network called Discriminator.**

**Generator generates counterfeit currency. Discriminators are a team of cops trying to detect the counterfeit currency. Counterfeiters and cops both are trying to beat each other at their game.**

Generatorâ€™s objective will be to generate data that is very similar to the training data. Data generated from Generator should be indistinguishable from the real data.

Discriminator takes two sets of input, one input comes from the training dataset(real data) and the other input is the dataset generated by Generator.

**Generator:**
The generator's main role is to create realistic data samples that are similar to the training data. It takes random noise as input and gradually transforms it into data samples that should resemble real data. The generator's architecture is typically a deep neural network, often constructed using layers like fully connected (dense) layers or convolutional layers in the case of images. The generator starts with random noise and progressively refines it through multiple layers to generate more complex and coherent samples.


**Discriminator:**
The discriminator's primary task is to distinguish between real data samples from the training dataset and fake samples generated by the generator. Like the generator, the discriminator is also a deep neural network. It takes input data (either real or fake) and produces a probability score indicating whether the input is real or fake. The discriminator's architecture is similar to that of a binary classifier, aiming to learn to differentiate between real and fake samples effectively.


**Training Process:**
- Generator Training: Initially, the generator produces fake data samples using random noise as input. These fake samples are then passed to the discriminator for evaluation.


- Discriminator Training: The discriminator receives both real data samples from the training set and fake samples from the generator. It is trained to correctly classify real samples as real (label 1) and fake samples as fake (label 0).

**Loss Functions:**
- **Generator Loss:** The generator's objective is to create samples that are convincing enough to fool the discriminator. To achieve this, the generator aims to minimize the difference between the discriminator's predictions on fake samples and the desired label (1, indicating real). In other words, the generator's loss function encourages it to produce samples that the discriminator thinks are real.


- **Discriminator Loss:** The discriminator's goal is to accurately classify real and fake samples. Its loss function involves a combination of the errors made on real and fake samples. The goal is to maximize the difference between its predictions on real and fake samples.

**Minimax Game:**

The training process can be understood as a minimax game where the generator and discriminator are engaged in adversarial training. The generator updates its parameters to minimize its loss while the discriminator updates its parameters to maximize its accuracy in distinguishing real from fake samples. This process leads to a dynamic equilibrium where the generator produces more realistic samples as the discriminator becomes better at its task.


### GAN Loss Functions

In a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), there are two primary loss functions: one for the generator and another for the discriminator.

**Generator Loss (L<sub>G</sub>)**

The goal of the generator is to produce data samples that are indistinguishable from real data. The generator loss is calculated based on the discriminator's classification of the generated samples. It can be expressed as the negative log likelihood of the discriminator being mistaken about the generated samples:

Where:
- **D(G(z))** is the discriminator's output when evaluating the generator's output, given random noise **z** as input.


**Discriminator Loss (L<sub>D</sub>)**

The discriminator's role is to differentiate between real and generated samples. Its loss is composed of two terms: one corresponding to the classification error for real samples and the other for fake samples. The discriminator aims to maximize its accuracy in distinguishing real from fake samples.

Where:
- **D(x)** is the discriminator's output when evaluating a real data sample **x**.
- **D(G(z))** is the discriminator's output when evaluating the generator's output, given random noise **z** as input.

 > ###### L = log(sigmoid(D(x))) + log(1-sigmoid(D(G(z))))


These loss functions create an adversarial training process, where the generator aims to minimize its loss by generating samples that the discriminator considers real, while the discriminator aims to maximize its loss by correctly classifying real and generated samples.
